## Introduction
The goal of understanding causality between variables is important in various fields, particularly in medical studies. One approach is to construct a causal graph through experimentation using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to minimize bias and confounding. However, when experimentation is not possible, causal relationships can be inferred using causal discovery algorithms. This can be challenging due to unknown confounding factors, mediators, and sample bias. The goal is to develop an algorithm that can recover the causal graph of datasets under different bias constraints, to be evaluated on synthetic datasets generated from a ground truth causal graph, even when data is altered by the presence bias.
